[{"content":"TL;DR – EKS Pod Identity (PI) lets you map an IAM Role to a Kubernetes ServiceAccount with a single API call, no OIDC-provider wrangling, and zero manifest annotations. It’s the successor to IRSA and is GA for clusters ≥ v1.27 (platform eks.8 or later).\nAdvantages of using EKS Pod Identity # Simpler than IRSA – no OIDC provider per-cluster and no trust-policy edits each time you add a cluster. Reusable roles – one role can be associated with SAs across many clusters. Lower STS load – credentials are fetched per-node by the EKS Pod Identity Agent and shared with pods on that node. Cleaner separation of duties – IAM admins manage roles, cluster operators manage associations. Prerequisites # EKS Cluster: Kubernetes 1.27 / platform eks.8\nInstall Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent (once per cluster) # Ensure that Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent Add On is installed in the cluster. If the add on is not already install, you can install it using AWS CLI or AWS Console.\nTo install Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent Add On using AWS Console, go to the EKS Dashboard in AWS Console, click on the EKS cluster and go to the \u0026ldquo;Add-ons\u0026rdquo; tab. Click on \u0026ldquo;Get more add-ons\u0026rdquo;. Then use the search option to find Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent. It should come under AWS add-ons. Select the Add on click Next. In the next window, ensure the add-on version is selected to latest. Then click on Next. In next window, click on Create to deploy this add-on. After some time, the status of the add-on will change to Active.\nTo install Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent Add On using AWS CLI, run:\naws --region $REGION eks create-addon --cluster-name $CLUSTER --addon-name eks-pod-identity-agent Replace $REGION and $CLUSTER with appropriate values.\nUsing EKS Pod Identity # Once the Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent Add On installed in the cluster, we can start using IAM role directly with pods deployed in our EKS cluster. Just like EC2 instance are able to access AWS services once they are assigned an IAM role.\nCreate an IAM role # Just adding the add on is not enough. We also need to ensure that service account associated with our workload has an access entry in the EKS cluster. To do so, we would need an IAM role with appropriate permissions and following trust policy:\n{ \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Service\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pods.eks.amazonaws.com\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;sts:AssumeRole\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sts:TagSession\u0026#34; ] } ] } Create a Pod Identity Association # aws --region $REGION eks create-pod-identity-association --cluster-name $CLUSTER --namespace $NAMESPACE --service-account $SERVICEACCOUNT --role-arn $ARN replace $REGION, $CLUSTER, $NAMESPACE, $SERVICEACCOUNT and $ARN with appropriate values.\nCreate the Deployment and ServiceAccount # Ensure the ServiceAccount:\napiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: $SERVICEACCOUNT namespace: $NAMESPACE Use this service account in the deployment:\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: awscli namespace: cipherops spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: awscli template: metadata: labels: app: awscli spec: serviceAccountName: ciops-services-sa containers: - name: awscli image: amazonlinux:2023 command: [\u0026#34;sleep\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;infinity\u0026#34;] Apply these manifest.\n# kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml deployment.apps/awscli created # If this exact manifest was used, then we would also need to install aws cli in it.

I will update here when that\u0026rsquo;s get implemented in production. (:\nApplicationSet Controller is the recommended way of app management. This article is not about ApplicationSet Controller. Documenting it here because it was a fun learning experience. I was introduced to ArgoCD back in September 2022. Fell in love with it right away. Amazing tool (Checkout ArgoCD if you haven\u0026rsquo;t). Initially, everytime a new service deployment came, I would go to the UI and add the service manually. This got out of hand really quickly. To handle this I wrote an Ansible playbook to do the addition for me. The playbook more or less looked like this:\n# # About: This playbook will create app for ArgoCD # Extra Variables: # required variables # argo_chart e.g. \u0026#34;nginx\u0026#34; # # optional variables # argo_ns e.g. \u0026#34;apps\u0026#34; eks cluster namespace where app will be installed. # argo_app_name e.g. \u0026#34;nginx-tier0\u0026#34; name that your would see in ArgoCD UI. if not given, name is calculated using chart name and tier # argo_tier e.g. \u0026#34;tier0\u0026#34; tier file for deployment. defaults to tier0. # repo_id e.g. \u0026#34;helmcharts\u0026#34; this will the key id in global vars file. defaults to helmcharts # cluster_url e.g. \u0026#34;kubernetes.default.svc\u0026#34; # revision_limit e.g. \u0026#34;5\u0026#34; defaults to 1 # app_branch e.g. \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; branch name for the helm chart repo, defaults to main # sync_policy e.g. \u0026#34;none\u0026#34; defaults to automated. this is how the app syncing will be done. If automated, then synced automatically. # argo_project e.g. \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; default argocd project where apps will be created. defaults to default --- - hosts: eks-controller-box become: true roles: - role: create-argocd-app where the create-argocd-app ansible role would just run an extended version of argocd command and the app would appear in the UI.\nI put this workflow behind Jenkins, reading the arguments and then passing them to Jenkins\u0026rsquo; exec statement. This is working and will continue to work without any issue for entirety of our setup. But somehow this didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a proper GitOps way of getting things done. And this would bother me all the time. Finally, I decided to do something about it.\nA quick google search to solve this problem took me to ArgoCD Cluster Bootstrapping. This article is about that.\nThe idea was pretty straight forward. I just had to create a helm chart, where all templates would have to be of kind: Application. I created a new Git repository, argocd-apps-bootstrap, and this was the directory structure:\n~/argocd-apps-bootstrap$ tree . ├── README.md ├── apps │ ├── infra │ │ ├── Chart.yaml │ │ ├── configs │ │ │ └── dev.yaml │ │ ├── templates │ │ │ └── echoserver.yaml │ │ └── values.yaml │ └── platform │ ├── Chart.yaml │ ├── configs │ │ ├── dev.yaml │ │ ├── prod.yaml │ │ └── staging.yaml │ ├── templates │ │ └── core.yaml │ └── values.yaml └── configs ├── common │ └── values.yaml ├── dev │ └── values.yaml ├── prod │ └── values.yaml └── staging └── values.yaml 12 directories, 15 files ~/argocd-apps-bootstrap$ Each file under repository\u0026rsquo;s root configs directory would contain values for variables. For example, ./configs/common/values.yaml would contain variables that would be common to all environments and all templates, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to redeclare them in each file:\n~/argocd-apps-bootstrap$ cat ./configs/common/values.yaml argocdNamespace: argocd appNamesapce: apps appProject: default appServer: https://kubernetes.default.svc appRevisionHistoryLimit: 2 appDefaultTier: tier0 ~/argocd-apps-bootstrap$ and the files ./configs/\u0026lt;env-name\u0026gt;/values.yaml would contain value of variables that would be specific to that environment.\nthen files like ./apps/infra/configs/dev.yaml would contain template specific variables\n~/argocd-apps-bootstrap$ cat apps/others/configs/dev.yaml echoserver: enabled: false ~/argocd-apps-bootstrap$ And then finally the template file itself will look something like this:\n{{- if .Values.echoserver.enabled }} apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata: name: echoserver-{{.Values.echoserver.tier | default .Values.appDefaultTier }} namespace: {{ .Values.argocdNamespace }} {{- with .Values.echoserver.annotations }} annotations: {{- toYaml . | nindent 4 }} {{- end }} finalizers: - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io spec: destination: namespace: {{ .Values.appNamesapce }} server: {{ .Values.appServer | squote }} project: {{ .Values.appProject }} revisionHistoryLimit: {{ .Values.appRevisionHistoryLimit }} source: helm: valueFiles: - ./environments/{{.Values.envName}}/{{.Values.echoserver.tier | default .Values.appDefaultTier }}/values.yaml - ./environments/{{.Values.envName}}/{{.Values.echoserver.tier | default .Values.appDefaultTier }}/images.yaml path: charts/echoserver repoURL: \u0026#39;git@\u0026lt;some-git-repo-url-where-your-actual-helm-charts-are\u0026gt;/helm-charts.git\u0026#39; targetRevision: {{ .Values.echoserver.repoBranch }} syncPolicy: automated: selfHeal: true prune: true {{- end }} In this above block, the lines under valueFiles are referring to the files present under source of the helm chart repository git@\u0026lt;some-git-repo-url-where-your-actual-helm-charts-are\u0026gt;/helm-charts.git and not under this app bootstrap repository.\nOnce all these are done and commited to git repository, I simply added one app using ArgoCD ui, whose eventual manifest would look like this:\nproject: default source: repoURL: \u0026#39;git@\u0026lt;git-repo-url\u0026gt;/argocd-apps-bootstrap.git\u0026#39; path: apps/infra targetRevision: main helm: valueFiles: - ../../configs/common/values.yaml - ../../configs/dev/values.yaml - ./configs/dev.yaml destination: server: \u0026#39;https://kubernetes.default.svc\u0026#39; syncPolicy: automated: prune: true selfHeal: true That\u0026rsquo;s it. From next time onwards, I just have to add files in this argocd-apps-bootstrap under their respective template folder. ArgoCD will sync the repo and do the rest for me. All I have to do now is add a file, raise a Merge Request and get it merged.\nWarning! Since this gives ability to add any applications to existing infra, ensure that the bootstrap repo itself is not writable without a review. This whole setup has been working really well for us. Now, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to run any Jenkins job. GitOps all the way.\nUntil next time.

Most of them are Spring Boot applications, involving application.properties file. These properties files are loaded via ConfigMaps. Since the company is in early stages of application development, these config maps are changing frequently. Up until now, we have been performing manual rollout restart of deployments whose config has changed.\nPretty soon it became obviously that our manual process is not going to scale well, and we needed to do something about it. That\u0026rsquo;s when we found this extremely wonderful project, Reloader.\nInstalling Reloader is rather very simple. There are multiple ways to do it. I went with helm chart way. Mostly because upgrading packages are lot easier using helm. This is what I did to install reloader in our EKS and GKE clusters:\nadd helm repo: helm repo add stakater https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts helm repo update create custom values.yaml file for the helm installation: cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | tee ~/reloader-values.yaml reloader: autoReloadAll: true EOF install reloader: helm install reloader stakater/reloader -n reloader \\ --create-namespace -f ~/reloader-values.yaml The values.yaml file can be found here. Most of the settings are self-explanatory. For us, the option autoReloadAll made more sense. This option basically starts reloader with argument --auto-reload-all.\nReloader, by default, will not watch for ConfigMaps/Secret changes, and we need to add extra annotation (like reloader.stakater.com/auto, etc.) to our deployments / daemonset / statefulset. But, when we use --auto-reload-all argument, all resources that do not have the auto annotation reloader.stakater.com/auto: \u0026quot;false\u0026quot;, will be reloaded automatically when their ConfigMaps or Secrets are updated.\nThis worked out so well for us that we sent it to production within 2 days of testing in development environments.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think necessity is the mother of invention.
